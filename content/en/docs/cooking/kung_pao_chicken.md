### Ingredients

- **400g (14 oz)** boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced
- **2 tbsp** soy sauce
- **1 tbsp** Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- **1 tsp** cornstarch
- **2 tbsp** vegetable oil
- **8-10** dried red chilies, seeds removed if desired (for less heat)
- **2 tsp** Sichuan peppercorns (optional)
- **2 cloves** garlic, minced
- **1 inch** ginger, finely chopped
- **1 small** onion, diced
- **1 small** green bell pepper, diced
- **1/4 cup** roasted peanuts
- **2-3** scallions, chopped

#### For the sauce

- **2 tbsp** soy sauce
- **1 tbsp** dark soy sauce
- **1 tbsp** black vinegar (or rice vinegar)
- **1 tbsp** sugar
- **1 tbsp** water
- **1 tsp** sesame oil

### Instructions

1. **Marinate the chicken**: In a bowl, mix the chicken with 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine, and 1 tsp cornstarch. Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes.

2. **Prepare the sauce**: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauces, vinegar, sugar, water, and sesame oil. Set aside.

3. **Heat the oil**: In a wok or large skillet, heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the dried chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry until the chilies darken slightly and become fragrant (about 30 seconds), being careful not to burn them.

4. **Stir-fry the chicken**: Add the marinated chicken to the wok and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until it's browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the wok and set aside.

5. **Cook the aromatics**: In the same wok, add the garlic, ginger, onion, and green bell pepper. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables soften slightly.

6. **Add the chicken back**: Return the cooked chicken to the wok, along with the sauce. Stir well to coat everything in the sauce.

7. **Finish the dish**: Add the roasted peanuts and scallions. Stir everything together for another 1-2 minutes.

8. **Serve**: Kung Pao Chicken is best served hot with steamed rice.

### Tips

- **Adjust heat**: To reduce the heat level, remove the seeds from the dried chilies or use fewer chilies.
- **Peanuts**: You can substitute cashews for peanuts for a different texture and flavor.
- **Vegan version**: Use tofu instead of chicken and adjust the marination accordingly.
