## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Eggplant**:
    - Sprinkle the eggplant pieces with a little salt and let them sit for 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture.
    - Rinse under cold water and pat dry.

2. **Cook the Ground Beef**:
    - Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat.
    - Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it into small pieces.
    - Drain any excess fat and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Aromatics**:
    - In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.
    - Sauté the garlic, ginger, and the white parts of the green onions for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. **Cook the Eggplant**:
    - Add the eggplant to the pan and stir-fry for 5-7 minutes, until soft and slightly browned.

5. **Combine the Beef and Seasonings**:
    - Return the cooked ground beef to the pan.
    - Stir in soy sauce, oyster sauce, chili paste (if using), and sugar.

6. **Thicken the Sauce**:
    - Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to create a slurry.
    - Pour the slurry into the pan and stir until the sauce thickens, coating the beef and eggplant.

7. **Serve**:
    - Garnish with the green parts of the green onions and fresh cilantro.
    - Serve hot with steamed rice or noodles.

## Notes

- **Eggplant Tip**: Salting the eggplant before cooking helps prevent it from absorbing too much oil.
- **Flavor Adjustments**: Adjust the soy sauce and sugar levels to your taste for a sweeter or saltier profile.
- **Vegetable Add-Ins**: Bell peppers, mushrooms, or zucchini can be added for extra texture and flavor.

## Nutritional Benefits

- **Eggplant**: Low in calories, high in fiber, and a good source of antioxidants.
- **Beef**: Provides protein, iron, and B vitamins, adding richness to the dish.
