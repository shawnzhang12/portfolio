## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Mushrooms**:
    - Clean the king oyster mushrooms by wiping them with a damp cloth.
    - Trim the tough ends and slice them into thin strips. For larger mushrooms, cut the strips in half.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics**:
    - Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
    - Add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

3. **Cook the Mushrooms**:
    - Add the sliced king oyster mushrooms to the skillet.
    - Stir-fry for approximately 3-4 minutes until the mushrooms turn golden brown.

4. **Add the Sauce**:
    - In a small bowl, combine the chili bean sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar.
    - Whisk until well blended, then pour the sauce mixture over the mushrooms in the skillet.

5. **Finish Cooking**:
    - Stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the mushrooms to absorb the flavors and become fully coated in the sauce.

6. **Serve**:
    - Remove from heat and garnish with freshly chopped green onions, if desired.
    - Serve hot as a side dish with steamed rice or alongside your favorite Asian meal.

## Notes

- **Heat Level**: Adjust the amount of chili bean sauce based on your spice preference.
- **Umami Boost**: For an extra punch of umami, try adding a splash of mushroom-based soy sauce.
- **Vegan Option**: Use a mushroom or plant-based oyster sauce for a fully vegan dish.

## Nutritional Benefits

- **King Oyster Mushrooms**: Low in calories, high in fiber, and a good source of protein for a plant-based diet.
- **Ginger and Garlic**: Adds anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties to the dish.
