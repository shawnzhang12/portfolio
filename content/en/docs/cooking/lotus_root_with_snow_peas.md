## Ingredients

- 1 medium lotus root (about 200-250g)
- 150g snow peas
- 1 small carrot (optional, for color)
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, finely sliced
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Salt to taste
- Water for blanching
- A few drops of rice vinegar (optional, to prevent lotus root from browning)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Lotus Root**:
    - Peel the lotus root and slice it into thin rounds (about 1/8-inch thick).
    - Place the slices in a bowl of water with a few drops of rice vinegar or lemon juice to prevent oxidation (browning).

2. **Prepare the Snow Peas**:
    - Wash the snow peas and trim the ends, removing the tough strings if necessary.

3. **Optional - Prepare the Carrot**:
    - Peel and thinly slice the carrot into rounds or julienne strips for added color.

4. **Blanch the Lotus Root and Snow Peas**:
    - Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a pinch of salt.
    - Blanch the lotus root slices for 1-2 minutes until slightly translucent but still crunchy.
    - Transfer the lotus root to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process, then drain.
    - In the same water, blanch the snow peas for 30 seconds until vibrant green. Drain and rinse under cold water.

5. **Stir-Fry**:
    - Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.
    - Add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
    - Add the blanched lotus root slices and stir-fry for 2 minutes to coat them with the garlic and ginger.
    - Add the snow peas (and optional carrots) and stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes.

6. **Seasoning**:
    - Add 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.
    - If using, add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce for extra flavor. Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until everything is well-coated and heated through.

7. **Serve**:
    - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if needed. Optionally, garnish with a sprinkle of white pepper or sliced chili for some heat.
    - Serve hot as a side dish or pair it with rice and a main course.

## Notes

- **Crunch Tip**: Be sure not to overcook the lotus root or snow peas to keep them crunchy.
- **Optional Veggies**: Feel free to add other vegetables like mushrooms, bell peppers, or baby corn for variety.
- **Vegan Option**: For a fully vegan dish, omit the oyster sauce or use a mushroom-based vegetarian version.

## Nutritional Benefits

- **Lotus Root**: High in fiber and vitamins, great for digestion.
- **Snow Peas**: Packed with vitamins A, C, and K, and low in calories.
