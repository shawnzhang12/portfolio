### Instructions

1. **Prepare the eggs**: Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them well. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.

2. **Cook the eggs**: Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and gently stir until the eggs are soft and scrambled, but not fully cooked. Remove the eggs from the wok and set aside.

3. **Stir-fry the ginger**: In the same wok, add 1 tbsp more oil. Add the sliced ginger and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

4. **Add the tomatoes**: Toss in the tomato wedges and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften and release their juices.

5. **Season the tomatoes**: Add the chicken bouillon powder, ketchup, oyster sauce, and a small pinch of sugar if desired. Stir well to coat the tomatoes evenly in the sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes are fully softened.

6. **Return the eggs**: Add the scrambled eggs back into the wok. Gently fold the eggs into the tomato mixture, letting them absorb the flavors. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until everything is well combined and heated through.

7. **Serve**: Garnish with chopped scallions if using, and serve hot with steamed rice.

### Tips

- **Adjust sweetness**: Add a small amount of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes if they are too tart.
- **Egg texture**: Cook the eggs to your desired doneness before removing them from the wok. They will cook a little more when you return them to the pan.
- **Vary the seasoning**: Adjust the amount of ketchup and oyster sauce to suit your taste. Some prefer more savory, others like a touch of sweetness.
