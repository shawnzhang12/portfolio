## Why we sleep



## Introduction

first blog i wrote, i deemed it out of everything going on in life, this was the top priority considering it accounts for 1/3 of your time, and it affects the remaining 2/3 greatly. Also perhaps one of the easier ones to actionably change (opposed to diet, exercise) and stick with it.

Breaking it up into a few sections:

Environment (part 1)

Practices (part 2)

Mentality (part 3)

Biological (part 4)

Extra (part 5)



# Part 1: Sleep Environment

## A. Lighting

### Sunrise and Sunset

>  [!NOTE]
>
> interesting

- [ ] why is this checkmark so ugly

### Artificial Lighting (Screen, Blue LEDs) before bed

add a warning/TODO note to anything that's actionable, or that the reader can change.

maybe also add a summary at the bottom that compiles all the TODOs/checkboxes.

- [x] Have

```markdown

Hi
```

### Total Darkness

I recommend a comfortable sleeping mask to block out all light, if blackout curtains are not as convenient for you.



## B. Temperature

### Room

### Body

- include bathing, showering, maybe a little bit of exercise?

### Seasons and Weather



## C. Sound

### Ambient noise

kill all plugs, electronics with their whirring, turn power stick off, all AC, fans, i hate noise, ear plugs

### Frequencies

how they affect the ear, and subsequently the brain, delta waves, brown noise, low frequency vs high frequency, pattern vs sudden



## D. Air Quality

### Dust, Humidity, Circulation, Scents

### Breathing techniques in part 3

## E. Bedding and Mattress

blanket weight, type, mattress cover, hardness, softness, material for seasons

pillow

## B. Sleep Position

pros and cons of back, where your legs are, stomach, right side vs left side, shoulder position, neck very important
